## Science Question(s)
1) What does the organization and structure of the shallow cumulus field look like in LASSO simulations on April 4, 2019?
2) How does this organization and structure of shallow cu differ from observations on April 4th, 2019?
3) How does near surface moisture influence evolution of shallow cumulus?


## Project Scope (what does success look like)?
A successful project will identify trends between cloud organization and evolution of shallow cumulus clouds over the Southern Great Plains. 

## Hypothesis (or Hypotheses)
- The scale of large scale forcing that will yield results closest to observations, depends on the date - there is no "one-size fits all" scale size.
- Increased surface moisture will cause earlier timing of shallow cumulus creation and deeper clouds (looking at observations on LASSO case dates)
